class KNNTransformer(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):
    """Transformer to generate new lag features by weighted aggregation
    of K-neighboring observations.

    A lag transformer uses a weighted mean/mode of the values of the
    K-neighboring observations to generate new lagged features. The
    weighted mean/mode of the surrounding observations are appended
    as a new feature to the right-most column in the training data.

    The K-neighboring observations are determined using the distance
    metric specified in the `metric` argument. The default metric is
    minkowski, and with p=2 is equivalent to the standard Euclidean
    metric.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, default = 7
        Number of neighbors to use by default for kneighbors queries.

    weights : {‘uniform’, ‘distance’} or callable, default=’distance’
        Weight function used in prediction. Possible values:

            - ‘uniform’ : uniform weights. All points in each
              neighborhood are weighted equally.
            - ‘distance’ : weight points by the inverse of their
               distance. In this case, closer neighbors of a query
               point will have a greater influence than neighbors
               which are further away.
            - [callable] : a user-defined function which accepts an
              array of distances, and returns an array of the same
              shape containing the weights.

    measure : {'mean', 'mode'}
        Function that is used to apply the weights to `y`. Use 'mean'
        if the target variable is continuous and 'mode' if the target
        variable is discrete.

    radius : float, default=1.0
        Range of parameter space to use by default for radius_neighbors
        queries.

    algorithm: {‘auto’, ‘ball_tree’, ‘kd_tree’, ‘brute’}, default=’auto’
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

            - ‘ball_tree’ will use BallTree
            - ‘kd_tree’ will use KDTree
            - ‘brute’ will use a brute-force search.
            - ‘auto’ will attempt to decide the most appropriate
               algorithm based on the values passed to fit method.
            - Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting
              of this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, default=30
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or KDTree. This can affect the
        speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree. The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    metric : str or callable, default=’minkowski’
        The distance metric to use for the tree. The default metric is
        minkowski, and with p=2 is equivalent to the standard
        Euclidean metric. See the documentation of DistanceMetric for
        a list of available metrics. If metric is “precomputed”, X is
        assumed to be a distance matrix and must be square during fit.
        X may be a sparse graph, in which case only “nonzero” elements
        may be considered neighbors.

    p : int, default=2
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances. When p = 1, this
        is equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and
        euclidean_distance (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p,
        minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    normalize : bool, default=True
        Whether to normalize the inputs using
        sklearn.preprocessing.Normalizer

    metric_params : dict, default=None
        Additional keyword arguments for the metric function.

    kernel_params : dict, default=None
        Additional keyword arguments to pass to a custom kernel
        function.

    n_jobs : int, default=None
        The number of parallel jobs to run for neighbors search. None
        means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means
        using all processors. See Glossary for more details.
